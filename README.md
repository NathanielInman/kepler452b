## Story
You are on the Cygnas System exploration regiment, sent 1400 light-years away from Earth to explore and take samples from the planet Kepler-452b, a super earth exoplanet in the habitable zone of a G2 star discovered 827 years ago today on August 23rd, 2015. You are one of 5 captains, your battalion having been the last to wake from cold sleep. The E-Class Starship Yuri has been orbiting K452b for almost 10 years now and communications with First Battalion at the forward operating base have been unanswered for the last two weeks.

The terminal manifest has uprooted audio logs of battalion staff officers having to suppress rumors of creatures native to K452b being grown and dissected. The only lead scientist aboard Yuri has noted that for the past 4 months the planet has begun to pulse strong wave emulsions that could directly be interfering with any wide-band communications.

Upon setting boots on ground, it's clear that the entire forward operating base has been compromised. In order to return home you have to retrieve all missing ship access keys from the other four captains. Gain the upper hand by acquiring more intel or methodically destroy any opposition to gain power. Command your team to whatever style suits you. It will take many lives to restore the balance, it'll only take a few to escape.

## Multiple Endings

1. Discover All Intel
  - You unlock classes by discovering intel
Win Opportunity 1: Discover all intel
	Each X amount of intel unlocks a new class
	Upon getting them all, you discover that the creatures were actually genetically modified humans and the actual purpose of reaching Cygnas was because itâ€™s flush in a few rare earth metals that have long been missing on Earth. Those metals were required to finish manufacturing an abomination of a creature - stemming from a human - who can grow by only consuming abundant gasses and whose sole purpose to exist is to be slaughtered and consumed as meat.

Win Opportunity 2: Find all 4 keys
	You leave Kepler-452b alive, the whole situation a mystery. As the starship Yuri begins to gate into leap-drive it gets damaged by a strange solar flare from the dying K452. The starship immediately loses all power and locks all passengers inside their cold-sleep chambers. The passengers all suffocate peacefully in their cold-sleep chambers as Yuri slowly drifts meaningless among the stars.
